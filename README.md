# QSExTra
Quantum Simulation of Exciton Transport

## Requirements
We advise the use of [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) environments for a clean setup.

Once Conda is installed, create a new environment and switch to it by running:
```
conda create --name qsextra_env
conda activate qsextra_env
```

Clone the repository using `git clone`.

From the parent repository folder, in your `qsextra_env`, the requirements can be installed with:
```
pip install -r requirements
```

Then, run the following to install the QSExTra package:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Example notebooks
There are example Jupyter notebooks illustrating usage of the package in the `Examples` folder.
